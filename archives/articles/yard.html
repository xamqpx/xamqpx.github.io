            <p>
                <inline class="padded-dropcap">O</inline>n one particularly unemployed evening recently, I was getting my ten thousand steps in with a long walk around the local community college. I had my headphones in, playing a paywalled &ldquo;Advice Show&rdquo; episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheYardPodcast">&ldquo;The Yard&rdquo;</a> from the Patreon app on my phone. Normally this is a podcast with four people, sitting on lawnchairs, who yap about <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/ep-48-premium-we-67545159?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share">matcha donuts</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/xbu0-W59UZg?si=X0_ZpmJwaaF-Kyut">cum</a> and whether their guests, regardless of gender, are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QEm8650eP0">cut or uncut</a>. But this particular offshoot features just two of those four, who had shoved themselves into a claustrophobic but neatly decorated broomcloset. One of them, Slime, fully reclined in a bench with his bare legs in the air, runs a crass bit about said legs for a little &mdash; &ldquo;You get the whole turkey tonight, bitch&rdquo; &mdash; then says, &ldquo;We basically run OnlyFans for pretending to have friends.&rdquo; The other, Aiden, takes a moment to process it. &ldquo;Oh, right &hellip; Fuck. We do.&rdquo;
            </p>

            <p>There was something that sparked in me when Slime said that. I looked up, and took in the landscape around me for the first time. Rolling hills and mountains sprawled in every direction, and yet somehow there was no towering landmark to truly set it apart from any other suburban-California purgatory. This fuckass neighborhood felt so long and wide, me by myself near the top of one of those hills, cold wind pushing me from behind. I was having one of those moments where I was realizing my entire life had brought me to where I was at that very moment: back from college, in a place where there was truly nothing, and no one, left for me. I felt small, then smaller, then somewhat normal again. Aiden and Slime&rsquo;s voices came back into focus. &ldquo;Denver is the Israel of the United States,&rdquo; Slime was saying.</p>

            <p>Just four months ago, &ldquo;The Yard&rdquo; was an entity that only existed in the periphery of my YouTube algorithm, subtly aligning itself with the Twitch streamers and the soothing slop content of that vein that I had already been watching at the time. Fast-forward to now, and I&rsquo;m on the fifteen-dollar monthly tier of their Patreon, so I can listen to four sensitive white boys talk for ninety <em>more</em> minutes and also watch them play <a href="https://youtu.be/WH8Nmk2R6hY?si=nCpFE_hUQ7aVKbVu">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, which I had never previously been remotely interested in, a week before the same episodes come out on YouTube. How did I get here?</p>

            <p>Ludwig Ahgren, Aiden &ldquo;<a href="https://liquipedia.net/smash/Calvin">Calvin</a>&rdquo; McCaig, Anthony &ldquo;<a href="https://liquipedia.net/smash/Slime">Slime</a>&rdquo; Bruno, and Nick &ldquo;<a href="https://x.com/falco?lang=en">Falco</a>&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Smasher:Envy_(California)">Envy</a>&rdquo; Vercillo were roommates, once upon a time, who met because of &ldquo;Super Smash Bros. Melee,&rdquo; that iconic fighting game for the Nintendo GameCube. The particulars of how they met and merged into the quartet they are today are irrelevant, although <a href="https://youtu.be/CvngICASKeM?si=E82kbe2fQGqzG7mz">that lore is public</a>. What is relevant is what happened after they started living together: Ahgren <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig%27s_subathon">blew up as a Twitch streamer</a>. By that point, long-time viewers of Ahgren had become quite familiar with his roommates, who naturally became fixtures of his livestreams. (Bruno, especially, had had a long history in the Melee community, having run a fairly popular podcast called &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BadMelee/videos">Bad Melee</a>,&rdquo; as well as being a frequent Melee tournament commentator and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdQWBDFDiMU">general on-stream duo</a> with Ahgren &mdash; to the extent that &ldquo;Slime&rsquo;s friend Ludwig&rdquo; used to be a bit on Ahgren&rsquo;s stream.)</p>

            <p>Their newfound &mdash; much broader &mdash; fame in hand, their next step was a foregone conclusion; white boys will be white boys. On 29 June 2021, &ldquo;The Yard&rdquo; posted its first video to YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wIzWplQusc">a short sketch</a> that set the stage for the four&rsquo;s dynamic for years to come. Then came the first proper episode, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkMVfxNDLa0">shingle bells,</a>&rdquo; on 8 July 2021.</p>

            <p class="photo-credit">VIDEO: <b>THE YARD/YOUTUBE</b> &mdash; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkMVfxNDLa0">shingle bells</a></p>


            <p>It&rsquo;s been four years and then some since that first episode, and &ldquo;The Yard&rdquo; is now the highest-earning creator on Patreon, at least among those who make their earnings publicly available. As of the time of publication, the podcast has 42,189 paying members (the seventh most of any Patreon creator) that earn them a total of $279,838 a month. Multiply that by twelve, then add the profits from the YouTube views and from sponsorships, then add the profits made from merchandise sales by Ahgren&rsquo;s company Mogul Moves, then divide that among the four members plus the behind-the-scenes crew (at the very least, the onsite producer and the editor) &mdash; any way you slice it, that makes for a cushy salary for what amounts to sitting on a lawn chair and talking to your friends through a Shure mic. And yet here <em>I</em> was, <em>paying</em> my own money for exactly that. Clearly, then, there was some other factor, besides being &ldquo;Ludwig&rsquo;s podcast,&rdquo; or the guest appearances, or even the comedy, that has drawn myself and tens of thousands of others to keep watching, and to turn &ldquo;The Yard&rdquo; into something of a lasting empire (to be a little dramatic). What was that?</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve had a particular affinity for podcasts for a while now. My earliest exposure to this sort of format and vibe was &ldquo;<a href="https://www.thebasementyard.com/">The Basement Yard</a>,&rdquo; a weekly series where two childhood best friends from Astoria, Queens, Frank Alvarez and Joe Santagato, seem to just turn on the camera and banter for an hour. You almost forget, if you listen to them say all the insane things they say, that both are in their thirties and Alvarez is a married father of two. The appeal is simple and immediate: you&rsquo;re thrust into the very real friendship between two men, and you get to be the hypothetical third person in the room, laughing and crying at the same things they do. The business model, at its core, is selling friendship. Not friendship between one person and yourself, necessarily, but an existing friendship between two people that you can find a great joy in observing.</p>

            <p>This is not revolutionary, obviously: fictional shows like &ldquo;Friends&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s in the damn title), &ldquo;Seinfeld,&rdquo; &ldquo;Community,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Office&rdquo; have been known to find immense success in displaying convincing relationships between characters &mdash; platonic or romantic &mdash; in which viewers could become deeply invested. But precisely because these were fictional works, there still existed that barrier where the manifestations of those dynamics started and ended on-screen. This didn&rsquo;t stop people from fantasizing about characters&rsquo; lives beyond the canons &mdash; hence why fanfiction exists &mdash; or even projecting the characters onto the actors themselves, clawing for any hint that the real-life counterparts were also close in a similar way and continuing to find satisfaction in that. Cast reunions and various public appearances catered to that desire, but there were limits to such things.</p>

            <p>Two major changes have happened in the entertainment space since then. The first is that algorithmically powered platforms have so fragmented public interests and media consumption patterns that it is difficult to imagine a show like those mentioned receiving that degree of universal attention ever again. The second is that, because those platforms have become so <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/the-age-of-enshittification">enshittified</a> over the past several years, people are now craving more desperately than ever for something that feels more real and authentic. Even podcasts, if you&rsquo;re looking in the wrong places, are all trying to sell you something, or to get something out of you. I guess I can tolerate being advertised to every once in a while; but most of the time, I just want to vibe. I just want to feel attached to something real.</p>

            <p>Objectively speaking, it is true that podcasts like &ldquo;The Basement Yard&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Yard&rdquo; fill this niche effectively, and have found sizable audiences because of it. (The former boasts <a href="https://graphtreon.com/creator/TheBasementYard">more than 36,000 paid Patreon members</a> with monthy earnings easily in the low six figures.) The similarity in names is coincidental, but they speak to the same sense of a shared male space, where the best conversations are had and the best memories made.</p>

            <p>But the greatest reasons, I think, that I now find myself in this position are the personal ones.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;ve always been somewhat obsessed with documenting the time I spend with friends. My memories of college and the people I met there are entirely structured through Instagram posts, screenshots of texts, pinned Discord messages, and some of the worst photos of any person to exist in the history of this planet. In larger group settings, though, I end up rarely speaking. It&rsquo;s relaxing enough to listen in while the rest of my friends talk to each other &mdash; almost like a podcast.</p>

            <p>In college, I didn&rsquo;t watch &ldquo;The Yard&rdquo; because I felt I didn&rsquo;t need it. But once I graduated and those social opportunities became fewer and fewer, it gave me exactly what I was missing: a look into another intimate universe of shared inside jokes, funny moments, and overall camaraderie that I could tap into at any moment. (And indeed, much like my own digital troves of memories that I could look through to reminisce on things, <q>The Yard</q> &rsquo;s community has their own <a href="https://yardsear.ch/">custom-built search engine</a> for every episode of the podcast.) <q>The Yard,</q> as a slice of that universe that they choose to put out into that world, is a comforting reminder of my own.</p>

            <p>I used to consider this a more or less unintentional parasocial consequence of the podcast. But it was surprising to hear from McCaig that the desire to share one's friends with the world was a mutual one:</p>

            <p>There was one final thing that cemented my fondness for <q>The Yard.</q></p>

            <p>Bruno&rsquo;s father had passed away in 2022, a few months after the podcast started. By the time I started watching, it had become a fixture of Bruno&rsquo;s lore and the go-to edgy joke he could make to get a laugh. But at some point, as I was catching up to the older episodes, I came across a Medium post that Bruno had written &mdash; his only one. <a href="https://medium.com/@slimewire/eulogy-for-a-gambler-5985e5c659e3"><q>Eulogy for a Gambler</q></a> was the title.</p>

            <p>It was a stunningly tender and affectionate portrait of a man from a son who had something of a reputation for being jokey and silly and also prone to rage. It also reminded me, to a degree I hadn&rsquo;t felt in many years, of my own deceased father. My dad died when I was far too young to have a fuller perspective on who he was and what he meant to me. When you&rsquo;re fourteen, your dad is your dad. I never had the opportunity to share memories with him as equals, adult to adult. But Bruno did &mdash; and yet, even he had his regrets.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>I told him, “One day you are going to die, and I won’t ever know who you are. You’ve never had a serious conversation with me.”</p>
                <p>He got quiet and stared out of the window for a few beats.</p>
                <p>“I’ll tell you one day,” he said. </p>
                <p>He never did, but what he said that day was enough. </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>I saw in Bruno that little piece of myself, of what could&rsquo;ve been with me and my dad. I saw in the four of them a resemblance of my own friends, and what we could be like years down the line. But that meant we'd have to continue being friends for that long, and the future is such a fickle and uncertain thing. Episode after episode of <q>The Yard</q> gives the impression that the guys would be friends forever, but who really knows? <q>We&rsquo;ll jokingly ask the question, &lsquo;Will we be friends forever?&rsquo; </q> McCaig says at one point, in the same Patreon episode. He then chokes up a little. <q>And &hellip; I hope so. I really hope so.</q></p>

            <p>All one can do, really, is hope. For now, though, there is the present. There&rsquo;s the friends and the memories we have at this very moment. And there&rsquo;s this week&rsquo;s episode of <q>The Yard.</q>&nbsp;&#9632;</p>
